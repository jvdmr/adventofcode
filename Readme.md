Advent of Code
==============

Read about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges, for better or worse.

To execute a specific solution
------------------------------
```bash
./run <path> [part]

# eg.
./run src/AoC2024/Day01 1  # will run the first part of the first day of 2024's challenges
./run src/AoC2023/Day05    # will run both parts of the fifth day of 2023's challenges
```

To start a new year
-------------------
```bash
./newyear <year>

# eg.
./newyear 2025  # will create the stubs for 2025's challenges
```

You will still need to add the modules to Main.hs and adventOfCode.cabal!
